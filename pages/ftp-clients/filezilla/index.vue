        As its name suggests, the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standardized
        network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server
        over the internet or any other TCP/IP network. FTP has been designed to
        promote sharing of files, across all types of computers. A strength of
        FTP is the reliable and efficient bulk transfer of files. FTP is popular
        with website owners and web designers to upload files to the servers of
        their web hosting company. Another common use case is the exchange of
        files between companies; FTP is in many organizations the de facto
        method for transferring large volumes of data.
