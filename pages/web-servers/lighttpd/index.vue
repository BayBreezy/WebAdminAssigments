        Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility -- all of these describe
        lighttpd (pron. lighty) which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a
        webserver; as it is designed and optimized for high performance
        environments. With a small memory footprint compared to other
        web-servers, effective management of the cpu-load, and advanced feature
        set (FastCGI, SCGI, Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and many
        more) lighttpd is the perfect solution for every server that is
        suffering load problems. And best of all it's Open Source licensed under
        the revised BSD license.

      <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Lighttpd does not support specific languages but protocols. They support
        CGI, HTTP, FastCGI, SCGI, AJP... PHP for example works with CGI and
        FastCGI, so that is supported. JSP uses AJP afaik, so that's supported
        too. Basically they support all major protocols.
